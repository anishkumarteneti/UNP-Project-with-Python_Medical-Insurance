# UNP-Project-with-Python_Medical-Insurance
UNP_PYTHON_PROJECT_MEDICAL_INSURANCE_DATASET
Completed this project as a part of my Python (Machine Learning) Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

Overview- This project covers various foundational aspects of a machine learning project including data preprocessing, data visualization, prediction using multiple models. The best-performing model was chosen for deployment.

Topics Covered :

Exploring the Dataset Converting Categorical Values to Numerical Plotting Heatmap to See Dependency of Dependent Value on Independent Features Data Visualization (Plots of Feature vs Feature) Data Preparation Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms (Classification) Logistic Regression K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Decision Tree Random Forest Plotting Graph for All Models to Compare Performance Preparing Model for Deployment Algorithms Comparison
